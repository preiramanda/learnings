## Learnings repo ðŸ“–

 ### This repository is where I save examples of code I've been working on. That may be useful for consulting logic or information later.

#### [Fake data generator:](https://github.com/preiramanda/learnings/tree/main/Fake_data_generator)

I created some fake data to use as a data set using the [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) Python package. It can be easily manipulated to fit different business rules from different activities. It's handy when you canÂ´t find free datasets that fit your needs.
